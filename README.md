# Sketching through servers
Applies multi-threaded server and client to connect two (or more computers) in order to draw and send these images, sort of like Google Docs for drawings. After much practice, I collaborated with a peer to create a game similar to the app store game called 'Draw something'.

## Language
Java

## Game Details
The game connects several players and assigns a specific role to each. The 'drawer' is in charge of thinking of a subject and drawing it to the best of their ability while the 'guessers' must compete to see who can figure out what the object is first.
